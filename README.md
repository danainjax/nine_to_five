# Nine_to_Five

Welcome to Nine_to_Five.

This is a basic job board application.

Capable of creating jobs, reading, updating, and deleting them.

This useful crud app was inspired by a Flatiron cohort-mate, *Yani Asari*. Often, she will post open jobs on a Slack channel to alert students of new positions. This led to the idea to structure this application around a locally curated job board relevant to a school, community group, place of worship, or club.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nine_to_five'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nine_to_five

## Usage

Type the following in the terminal to execute the program:
    rackup

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
